# An interactive image comparison tool with IPython widgets

An image comparison tool based on the IPython interactive widget architecture.

The notebook included here is an illustration of how to build an IPython widget
for a real-world use case: intercactive exploration of the differences between
two images (inspired by
[Github's image diff](https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes)).

Thanks to [Neil Lawrence](http://www.shef.ac.uk/neuroscience/staff/lawrence),
from U. Sheffield, for the invitation to speak at his data science meetup. A
lunch discussion provided the motivation to write the first version of this
tool 15 minutes before the seminar, and it worked with plenty of seconds to
spare.
